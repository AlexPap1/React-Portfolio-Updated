## 🖊️ Description 🖊️
<br />

This is my new updated portfolio using React! The portfolio now features multiple tabs for About Me, my Portfolio, Contact info, and my Resume. This site is designed to showcase my work in software development while also introducing myself as an individual.
<br />
I included links to the "About Me", "My Work", and "Contact Me" sections to make the site easier to navigate.

**About Me**

In the About Me seciton, I added a recent photo of myself as well as a short paragraph about myself including my education history, my interests/hobbies, and my desire to get into software development.

**My Work**

In the My Work Section, I added images of the projects I have worked on prior to the portfoilio, with links to those portfilios where appliable.

**Contact Me**

My email, phone, and LinkedIn are included in the footer for all pages. Where each link will send the reader to their phone, email, or LinkedIn apps with a direct to my contact. This was done to make it easier to contact me and also to make sure there was nothing lost in transcribing my information into those respective apps. The contact page includes a form which checks for email regex, as well as a spot for name and message. An error will appear if those are left blank upon hitting submit denoting they are required fields.

**Resume**

This section includes a download link to my most recent resume draft updated for expressing my desire to work in software development. This is a .pdf that is saved within the images folder.
